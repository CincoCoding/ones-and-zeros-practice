# ones-and-zeros-practice
modified from a program written by instructor Kevin Lee from Normandale Community College

/*
    Kevin Lee
    Sample program for CSCI
    
    This program illustrates how ASCII characters,
    integers and floats are stored as binary bits.
    
    Some students find this a bit too much but I don't worry
    about their two-bit opinions!
